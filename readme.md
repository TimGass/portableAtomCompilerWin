# Mobile Atom with C++ Gnu compile for Windows

This is the scripts and packages I am using. However, AtomPortable.exe, found at https://sourceforge.net/projects/atomportable/, must be
downloaded and installed and MinGW-w64, found at https://sourceforge.net/projects/mingw-w64/, for 32 bit and 64 bit and LLVM, found at http://releases.llvm.org/5.0.1/LLVM-5.0.1-win64.exe, need to be installed
and put in the Atom folder as well as compile.bat. Terminal in Atom should use
compile.bat and pass folder and filename to perform compilation. This should give
you a portable, working Atom that can compile cross-platform C or C++, depending
on how you set it up (it is designed for C++). I don't claim to own anything
other than the scripts that I have written and I do not claim to own Atom or LLVM
or MinGW-w64. I just am offering my own personal blend for my use and for others.
